## 🌟 Overview

**Medical AI Assistant** is a full-stack, multi-agent chatbot that simulates a clinical triage workflow. It collects patient symptoms, retrieves relevant medical knowledge from a PDF, generates a differential diagnosis, assesses urgency, finds real doctors from a local database, and handles appointment booking — all through a natural conversation interface built with Streamlit.

**No installation needed** — try it instantly at [medical-ai-diagnose.streamlit.app](https://medical-ai-diagnose.streamlit.app/)

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system is built as a collection of independent **agents**, each responsible for one step of the medical workflow. The **Streamlit UI** orchestrates the flow using a simple phase-based state machine — no compiled graph is invoked at runtime.

All agents share a single `state` dictionary (defined in `state/schema.py`). The UI reads flags from the state to decide which agent to call next.

```



---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Click **"Start Consultation"**
2. Describe your symptoms and city — e.g., *"headache and fever in Delhi"*
3. The bot runs an initial diagnosis. If more information is needed, it will ask one clarifying question (max 2 rounds)
4. The **Triage** result is shown — if it's an emergency, a detailed warning with ER instructions appears
5. In free-chat mode, ask follow-up questions, then say **"find doctor"** to search for a specialist
6. Select a doctor by number, choose a valid day and time slot, enter your contact info, and confirm
7. A booking confirmation email is sent (or mocked if SMTP is not configured)

## 🛠️ Customisation

| What to change | Where to change it |
|---|---|
| Symptom → speciality mapping | `SPECIALITY_MAP` in `agents/doctor_finder.py` |
| Red flag keywords | `RED_FLAGS` in `agents/triage.py` |
| Max diagnosis follow-up rounds | `MAX_DIAGNOSIS_ROUNDS` in `agents/diagnosis.py` |
| Add more cities | Expand `data/doctors.xlsx` |

## ⚠️ Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

- **Not a medical device** — for demonstration purposes only; always consult a qualified doctor
- RAG quality depends on the medical PDF provided; incomplete sources may affect accuracy
- Doctor availability is static (Excel file); no real-time slot checking

### Planned Improvements

- [ ] Real-time doctor availability via Google Calendar or Practo API
- [ ] SMS appointment reminders via Twilio
- [ ] Persistent user memory — returning users skip intake
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Hosted demo with live doctor search
